# Massenger
Massenger project, it's simple project to Send and receive messages using three-tier architecture.

i build this project for Connect with your friends and family

it's important when someone went to another city so you can connect with him by messages.

The features are:
3-Tier(Presentation, Businesse, DataAccess)

Login, Account info, messages, people(It has CRUD OP), your messages

The tables in sql were{Person, Messages, Countries, Block}

And library has some classes like{Text processing, Color Controls, etc...}

i used C# .Net Frameworks and Sql Server

I faced some problems because it's the first try to implement project by 3-tier architecture after i learned it


in the end if you want some details about this game ask me
